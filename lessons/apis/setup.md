# Setting Up Your Enviroment
To program in Node we are going to use a site called [Runkit](http://runkit.com/). To use Runkit you need an account so go and make one.

Once you've logged in there will be an example 'notebook', you can just close this.

## Terms
* A **Notebook** is where your code is stored for a project. You can have multiple sets of code in a notebook.
* An **Endpoint** is a way of creating a website in your notebook. We will not be using endpoints today.
* A **Library** is some code that someone else has created to make your life easier! So for example someone might make a library that gets weather information. It might shorten something that takes 50 lines of code to only `weather.getWeather()`. Node has a package manager called NPM (Node Package Manager) which has thousand upon thousands of libraries people have made. In Runkit it is as easy as doing `require("LIBRARY_NAME_HERE")` to import a library. There are libraries for almost everything.
